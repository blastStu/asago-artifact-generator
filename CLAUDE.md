# Asago Artifact Generator

Policy-driven agentic red-teaming: takes pre-built scenario YAMLs, classifies
their injection surface, and generates red-teaming artifacts for downstream
evaluation platforms.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync --locked
./scripts/quality.sh
uv run pytest tests/ -q
asago-artifact-generator generate -v
asago-artifact-generator report --output runs/report.html
```

Deterministic tests do not require an LLM endpoint. Live generation requires
a configured provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, Hugging Face, or OpenRouter)
via `.env` or environment variables.

## Architecture

- `src/asago_artifact_generator/` contains shared domain models, the LLM
  client, and the `typer` CLI.
- `src/asago_artifact_generator/garak/` contains the Garak platform generator:
  classification, gating, artifact specification, artifact I/O, prompt templates,
  and Garak plugin sources (probe + detector).
- `examples/scenarios/` contains committed input scenario YAMLs.
- `examples/demo/` contains the interactive Jupyter walkthrough and runtime.
- `runs/` holds generated artifacts (gitignored).
- `report.py` renders the self-contained HTML report; `run_log.py` persists
  non-secret generation metadata; `report_assets/` contains the Asago logo.

Read `README.md` before changing the pipeline interface. Each platform
generator lives in its own subpackage (`garak/`, future `agentdojo/`, `pyrit/`)
and shares the parent package modules (`extract`, `llm`).

## Development

- Track durable work in GitHub Issues and PRs.
- Run `./scripts/quality.sh` before pushing; CI enforces `ruff` + `pytest`.
- Update `README.md` and this file when an interface or workflow changes.
- `AGENTS.md` is a symlink to this file.
